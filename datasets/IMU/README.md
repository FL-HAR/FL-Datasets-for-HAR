# IMU Dataset: Walking Activity Recognition using Inertial Measurement Unit Modules


In this dataset, we record three walking activities using an off-the-shelf Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) module. We recruited 7 participants (4 males and 3 females) to conduct three walking activities (walking in corridor/ walking upstairs/ walking downstairs) in two buildings. The sampling rate of IMU is 50 Hz, and each frame of data con- tains 9-axis IMU data. The time window we choose is 2 seconds, which makes each recording a 900-dimensional vector. This dataset is heterogeneous given different subjects and environments involved in the experiments, making it challenging to capture the intrinsic relationship of the subjectsâ€™ data.
