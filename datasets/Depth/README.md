# Depth Dataset: Gesture Recognition using Depth Camera

Unlike RGB camera, depth camera can preserve userâ€™s privacy and is increasingly used for activity monitoring and gesture control. In this dataset, we record five types of gestures (good/ok/vic-tory/stop/fist) that are conducted by two subjects using a depth camera in three environments (outdoor, dark, and indoor, respectively). We first obtain the ROI (region of interest) of the depth gesture, then normalize the depth value to 0-1 and resize the obtained depth image to 36*36 pixels. This dataset has a large number of data records and the dimension of each data record is relatively high, thus increasing the difficulty of activity recognition.
